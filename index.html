			<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vladislavtrukhin/android_project">Shopping Application</a></h2>
			<p>
				Technologies: Java, Android, GCP, XML, SQLite, SVN
			</p>
			<p>
				An Android shopping application built primarly with Java.
				GCP was used for the Cloud Translation API to make the application localized through translation.
				The application tracks products purchased, user accounts, inventory and prices through SQLite.
				The project was completed with 4 other students, which I took the role of leadership to
				guide the group through the development process.

			<h2><a href="#projects">Image Processor</a></h2>
			<p>
				Technologies: C, Data Structures, Algorithms
			</p>
			<p>
				An image processor that was built through C. The processor utilizes Quadtree data structures to
				conduct several operations on an image. It was one of the projects that propelled my 
				interest in software development and that I am highly proud of.

				This website was a project I did to teach myself more about web development. This website and its code
				is fully original with some free assets used for icons and background pictures. The website is hosted in

			<q><i>Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.</i></q><br> - Mahatma Gandhi
			<p>	
				<br>
				I live by this idea day to day. I am in constant pursuit of knowledge and see myself as an
				unstoppable lifelong learner. I value the ability to learn far more than the ability to know, as over time,
				new knowledge must be taken in and the old must be put to rest.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's for this reason why I chose the field of computer science, as the never ending development of new 
				technologies keeps me engaged. Especially with the advent of emerging technologies that have the potential 
				to disrupt our world, it makes computer science an invaluable skill to have. Maybe I will eventually be one of the 
				forces responsible for driving change in the world of technology.
			</p>
				I am interested in many fields of computer science. From software programming, to system engineering, 
				from networking, to artificial intelligence, they are all fields which I am currently developing experience in.
				As a result, I am very versatile in what work I can do, with no field being off limits for me. Even though there might be
				some fields which my knowledge may be lacking, I will be sure to learn and master it in no time.
			<p>
				I am constantly working on my own projects. I use these projects to refine my skill of doing, as I have hopes
				of eventually making something truly unique and not-done-before. It also gives me great joy of completing a project
				I have invested my time and labor in and one I can be proud to share to the world. This website is one of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				If I sound like the person who is needed to solve your task, please do not hesitate to contact me. I take great joy in helping others
				and working with them towards a goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				I reside in the Bay Area of California and pursue my studies of computer science and statistics at the University of
				Toronto. I am a citizen of both Canada and the U.S. which gives me the unique opportunity to work
				anywhere across North America.
